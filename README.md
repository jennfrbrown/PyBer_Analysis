# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to perform exploratory data analysis for PyBer, a ride-share company.  Once the analysis is complete, we will make graphs to show the data is a compelling, visual way.  This analysis focuses on the relationship between city type - urban, suburban, and rural - and its relationship to fares, number or drivers, number of rides, and when those rides occurred.  We are specifically looking at data collected from January to early May 2019.

  - Rural cities have the highest Average Fare per Ride, 1.4 times higher than Average Fare by Ride in urban cities and 1.1 times higher than Average Fare by Ride in suburban ciies.  This is supported by rural cities having a greater distance between destinations, thus potentially having longer rides.

- Average Fare per Driver
 - Rural cities have the highest Average Fare per Driver, 3.3 times higher than Average Fare by Driver in urban cities and 1.4 times higher than Average Fare by Driver in suburban ciies.  This is supported by rural cities having a greater distance between destinations, thus potentially having longer rides and rural cities also having the least number of drivers.
