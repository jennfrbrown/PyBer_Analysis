# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to perform exploratory data analysis for PyBer, a ride-share company.  Once the analysis is complete, we will make graphs to show the data is a compelling, visual way.  This analysis focuses on the relationship between city type - urban, suburban, and rural - and its relationship to fares, number or drivers, number of rides, and when those rides occurred.  We are specifically looking at data collected from January to early May 2019.
